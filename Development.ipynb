      "\"which requires Senators to be directly chosen by the\n",
      "people\". Secondly, Mr Ruddick pleaded that the impugned provisions burdened\n",

      "\n",
      "139\t\tIn relation to both pleaded reasons for invalidity, Mr Ruddick\n",

      "paper as a means of electoral communication, including by reference to a\n",

      "the impugned provisions vest property in party names and political traditions in\n",
      "incumbent parties. The\n",
      "\"specific burden\" Mr Ruddick focused upon was the\n",
      "consequences of the objection by the Liberal Party, namely that if the Liberal\n",
